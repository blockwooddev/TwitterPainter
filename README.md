# README for TwitterPainter

I started with Darius Kazemi's examplebot: https://github.com/dariusk/examplebot

This bot used to read tweets it was tagged in, take the first hashtag, and retweet the first post it found with that hashtag (maybe the one it was tagged in). 

By following Daniel Shiffman's tutorial on Twitterbots (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF5_MPSNAtU) I was able to edit the bot to upload images in reply to a tweet.
